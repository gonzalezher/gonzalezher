## Key Titans

This project is a game developed in Unity with a side view in which enemies are defeated by typing words, being able to use combos to do more damage.
At each stage of the game you are confronted by enemies, and the only way to defeat them is to write words. Each word deals a different amount of damage, and it is given by colors, which are:
 
- <font size="4"> Green: This one does the least damage, but it is the easiest to write. </font>
- <font size="4"> Blue: The second is the one that does half damage, but it is not hard to write. </font>
- <font size="4"> Red: The third does the most damage, but they're the toughest to write. </font>

You also have the possibility to perform combos which require you to type a lot of words in a row or a long string of letters, which ends up doing a lot of damage to the enemy if you get it right. 

On the other hand, before each level you can choose two spells that you can use in the game, which can give you benefits such as shields that protect you from damage, or powerful attacks that quickly finish off your enemies. All of them have a unique way of activating that requires you to spell them correctly.
